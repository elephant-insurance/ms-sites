# ms-sites

ms-sites is a very simple microservice designed to serve as a starting-point for new microservices. At present, it simply sets up a directrory structure and a dependency structure, and builds a trivial Docker web service. 

Future versions will link additional features from the microservice architecture, and will offer script-driven reconfiguration for turning "ms-sites" into whatever new microservice you require.
